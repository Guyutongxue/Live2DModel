# README of repo "Live2DModel"

## What's this?

This is a git repo for personal uses. You aren't & won't be expected to know exactly what it is either how it works.

## But... why a git repo?

I want to use Live2D Wallpaper on an iOS device through HTML. But `live2d.js` doesn't allow user to load models from local resources. So I created this to fit it and make it works.

## How it works?

Firstly use tweak [Xen HTML](http://xenhtml.incendo.ws/) to enable HTML widgets on SpringBoard / Lock Screen. Then use the method and code in [here](https://imjad.cn/archives/lab/add-dynamic-poster-girl-with-live2d-to-your-blog-02) to show a model in a website. Put all things together in `/var/mobile/Library/SBHTML` before enable it.
